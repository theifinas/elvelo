      Q: Are your products 100% manufactured by Boosted?
    </p>
    <p>A: Yup, we acquired everything that Boosted had, and it came direct from them.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: What if something says out of stock?</p>
    <p>A: We are absolutely not permitted to create new products for / by Boosted because their IP was sold off. We can
      only sell the rest of the stock that we have. Supplies are extremely limited, this is the last of Boosted's stock
      and when it's gone it's gone forever. Once something says sold out, that is it, you will not be able to get it
      again.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: Who pays for shipping?</p>
    <p>USA answer: We will pay for shipping on anything over $100. If you need something repaired you will be required
      to pay for shipping both ways. If your board requires a warranty part we will do our best to ship you a
      replacement part on us to get you back up and rolling.

      Canadian answer: Please see <router-link to="/shipping">

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: Where are you located, can I come in for a visit?</p>
    <p>A: We are located in San Francisco, CA and are not open to the public.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: I am international, specifically Canada.  Can I buy from you?</p>
    <p>A: We are now shipping to Canada! We are actively trying to go more international, please keep an eye on our instagram @boosted_usa to stay up to date on announcements.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: I am going to use a freight forwarder. What happens if they can not forward the order because of a battery or other issue?</p>
    <p>A: Regardless of us warning people, some people have tried to use a freight forwarder to order boards and scooters.  If your board or scooter gets rejected and returned to us, we will refund you - $200 / unit, to cover our shipping and rerouting fees. (Yes it costs us approximately $200 when your order gets rejected)</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: How about Alaska or Hawaii?</p>
    <p>A: As much as we would like to ship to you, Fedex and UPS are very specific about our batteries traveling on airplanes so we can not ship to either of those states.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: Then who are you guys?</p>
    <p>A: We are the guys who bought all of the remaining inventory from Boosted after they shut their doors.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q: I need a replacement part that I don't see on your site.</p>
    <p>A. That's not a question but you should know that we're continuing to receive boxes of goods and as we find items we will be adding them to our website for sale.  Please keep an eye on the site in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold">Q. Will you be receiving more 105 wheels and/or Beams?</p>
    <p>A. We hope so but again, we're unboxing products as fast as we can.  We expect to see more of these items and we will add them to the site as soon as we do.  In the meantime make sure to add your email to the "notify me" box and you'll get an email as soon as more stock is added.</p>
