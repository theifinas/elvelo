      <p>-After you submit the order, it is firm. Do NOT order something and then send a message asking the order to be canceled or you are in for bad news. Turning international orders around is highly expensive and difficult.</p>

      <p> -All orders ship UPS. You will be responsible for taxes, duty, customs, brokerage fees, etc. You will owe these fees upon delivery. Orders will not be refunded or canceled because you did not expect to pay these fees. Fees are estimated between 10% and 20% of the total order value but depend on your province. Please note these fees could be more, and we do not control them.</p>

      <p>Shipping on items between $1-$500 USD has a flat fee of $70</p>

      <p> Shipping on items between $501 and up has a flat fee of $150</p>

      <p>-We try to be as reasonable as possible with shipping.  If for some reason shipping to your address is not feasible, you will be contacted and given the option to pay the difference or we will refund you ASAP.</p>
